# Project Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on predicting credit card customer churn to help the bank identify which customers are likely to stop using their services. Using the financial, behavioral and demographic data identify the factors effecting customer churn. Create interactive dashboard using PowerBI to visualize the churn patterns and behaviours, able to identify potential customers who are likely to churn. Thereby providing actionable insights so the bank/institution can come up with strategies to retain customers.

## Dataset Content
* BankChurners.csv downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/data)
* The dataset contains details of features like customer demographics, credit card usage, credit limit, balance, transaction history, etc.

## Business Requirements
* Identify customers who are at risk of churning (closing their credit card accounts) so that proactive retention strategies can be developed.
* By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, the bank can improve its services and customer satisfaction.
* Develop interactive dashboards to visualize churn patterns and behaviors, enabling the bank to make data-driven decisions.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 

1.	Customers with higher education levels are less likely to churn. 
2.	Higher-income customers are less likely to churn than lower-income customers.
3.	High card utilisation is positively associated with churn.
4.	Older customers are less likely to churn compared to younger customers.
5.	Customers with more inactive months in the past year are more likely to churn.
6.  Customers with fewer transactions are more likely to churn than those with frequent transaction.
7.  Customers with fewer transactions (Total_Trans_Ct) are more likely to churn than those with frequent            transactions.
8.  Marital status and dependent count might have an impact on customer churn â€” e.g., single customers or those with fewer dependents may have higher churn rates.


## Project Plan
1. Ideation and Team Collaboration:
    Since its a hackathon project, the team brainstormed ideas and selected the topic of Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis. The team collaborated on defining the project scope, setting up the workspaces, the project board(for various tasks), and deliverables.

2. Data Collection and Understanding:
    The dataset was taken from Kaggle and the team explored the dataset to understand the features and initial observations.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
### Business Requirement 1: Identify at-risk customers
**Rationale**: Create predictive visualizations that highlight customers with high churn probability
- **Churn Probability Heatmap**: Visual representation of customer risk scores across different segments
- **Customer Risk Dashboard**: Interactive filters to identify high-risk customers by demographics and behavior
- **Churn Prediction Model Results**: Confusion matrix and ROC curves to validate model performance

### Business Requirement 2: Understand churn factors
**Rationale**: Develop analytical visualizations to reveal patterns and correlations in customer behavior
- **Feature Importance Charts**: Bar charts showing which factors most influence churn decisions
- **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap displaying relationships between variables and churn
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and box plots comparing churned vs retained customers across key metrics

### Business Requirement 3: Enable data-driven decisions
**Rationale**: Create executive-level dashboards that translate complex data into actionable business insights
- **Executive Summary Dashboard**: High-level KPIs and trends for leadership decision-making
- **Segment Analysis Views**: Breakdown of churn rates by customer segments (income, age, card type)
- **Retention Strategy Recommendations**: Visual guides for targeted intervention strategies

## Analysis techniques used
### Data Analysis Methods
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries and distribution analysis
   - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables
   - Missing value analysis and data quality assessment
   - Use of y-data to gain deeper insights of datasets including correlations and interactions

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created derived features like utilization ratios and transaction frequency metrics
   - Categorical encoding for machine learning models
   - Feature scaling and normalization

3. **Machine Learning Techniques**
   - **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model for interpretability
   - **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for feature importance analysis
   - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Advanced ensemble for improved prediction accuracy
   - **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier (already included in dataset)

### Structure and Justification
The analysis was structured in three phases:
1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Understanding current churn patterns
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Building models to forecast future churn
3. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Developing actionable recommendations

### Data Limitations and Alternative Approaches
- **Limitation**: Imbalanced dataset with fewer churned customers
  - **Solution**: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and class weighting
- **Limitation**: Limited temporal data for trend analysis
  - **Alternative**: Used cross-sectional analysis with behavioral proxies
- **Limitation**: Missing external economic factors
  - **Mitigation**: Focused on internal behavioral and demographic patterns

### Generative AI Usage
- **Ideation**: Used AI tools to brainstorm feature engineering ideas and hypothesis generation
- **Code Optimization**: Leveraged AI for code review and performance optimization suggestions
- **Design Thinking**: AI-assisted dashboard layout and visualization selection recommendations

## Ethical considerations
### Data Privacy Issues
- **Challenge**: Customer financial data contains sensitive personal information
- **Mitigation**: Implemented data anonymization techniques and removed direct identifiers
- **Compliance**: Ensured adherence to GDPR and banking data protection regulations

### Bias and Fairness
- **Identified Bias**: Potential discrimination based on demographic factors (age, gender, income)
- **Fairness Measures**: Implemented fairness metrics to ensure equal treatment across demographic groups
- **Model Auditing**: Regular bias testing across different customer segments

### Legal and Societal Considerations
- **Transparency**: Developed explainable AI models to ensure decision transparency
- **Customer Rights**: Implemented processes for customers to understand and challenge automated decisions
- **Responsible AI**: Established guidelines for ethical use of churn predictions in customer interactions
