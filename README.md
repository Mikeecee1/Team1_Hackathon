# Project Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on predicting credit card customer churn to help the bank identify which customers are likely to stop using their services. Using the financial, behavioral and demographic data identify the factors effecting customer churn. Create interactive dashboard using PowerBI to visualize the churn patterns and behaviours, able to identify potential customers who are likely to churn. Thereby providing actionable insights so the bank/institution can come up with strategies to retain customers.

## Dataset Content
* BankChurners.csv downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/data)
* The dataset contains details of features like customer demographics, credit card usage, credit limit, balance, transaction history, etc.

## Business Requirements
* Identify customers who are at risk of churning (closing their credit card accounts) so that proactive retention strategies can be developed.
* By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, the bank can improve its services and customer satisfaction.
* Develop interactive dashboards to visualize churn patterns and behaviors, enabling the bank to make data-driven decisions.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 

1.	Customers with higher education levels are less likely to churn. 
2.	Higher-income customers are less likely to churn than lower-income customers.
3.	High card utilisation is positively associated with churn.
4.	Older customers are less likely to churn compared to younger customers.
5.	Customers with more inactive months in the past year are more likely to churn.
6.  Customers with fewer transactions are more likely to churn than those with frequent transaction.
7.  Customers with fewer transactions (Total_Trans_Ct) are more likely to churn than those with frequent            transactions.
8.  Marital status and dependent count might have an impact on customer churn â€” e.g., single customers or those with fewer dependents may have higher churn rates.


## Project Plan
1. Ideation and Team Collaboration:
    Since its a hackathon project, the team brainstormed ideas and selected the topic of Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis. The team collaborated on defining the project scope, setting up the workspaces, the project board(for various tasks), and deliverables.

2. Data Collection and Understanding:
    The dataset was taken from Kaggle and the team explored the dataset to understand the features and initial observations.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. From the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
